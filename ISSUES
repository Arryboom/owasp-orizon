List of known issues _ v1.30 (20100117)

Owasp Orizon is not a perfect tool and I will never be bugs free (but we will 
fight against this list growing too much! :-))

20100117.1 - [MODEL] The JspExitPoint class has a outPrintlnParse() method
used to parse a out.println() source string. It uses a StringTokenizer to 
divide fixed string from vars. If a method call is used within a out.println
it will be interpreted as variable name, so something can be missing.
Must investigate further is such a bug can introduce false potives.

20100105.1 - [MIRAGE/Jsp] The Jsp parser has a strange behavior  when it 
encounters a closing tag. A </TAG> is treated as a new <TAG> element with the
same attributes of the real opening tag
